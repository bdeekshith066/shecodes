# SheCodes - 2024
### A 30 hour hackathon organized by WTM REVA at REVA University on June 14th - 15th from 10am to 5pm

## Our Idea 
To revolutionize scalp cooling therapy in India with a comprehensive, patient-centric approach. By leveraging innovative IoT technology, precision cooling mechanisms, and AI-driven personalized care, our solution aims to bridge the gap between existing scalp cooling systems and the unmet needs of patients across the nation.
